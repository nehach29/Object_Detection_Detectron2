# Object_Detection_Detectron2
Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image. Detectron2 is a state-of-the-art deep learning framework developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) that has revolutionized the field of object detection and instance segmentation. 
Building upon its predecessor, Detectron, Detectron2 offers enhanced performance, scalability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision.

At its core, Detectron2 leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and incorporates modern techniques such as Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and Cascade R-CNN to achieve accurate and efficient object detection. The framework is built using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, which provides flexibility and facilitates experimentation.

One of the key strengths of Detectron2 lies in its extensive library of pre-trained models, including models with different backbones like ResNet, ResNeXt, and MobileNet. These pre-trained models enable rapid development and transfer learning, especially for scenarios with limited labeled data.

Detectron2 is highly customizable, allowing users to fine-tune existing models or even train models from scratch, tailoring them to specific detection tasks and datasets. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from general object detection to specialized use cases like vehicle detection, pedestrian tracking, and more.
